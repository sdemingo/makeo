	WHAT IS MAKEO

It's a really simple stack-based virtual machine and a intermediate
languaje interpreter named MK. You can see the reference of this
simple language in the wiki of the project. It has not a particular
target. I have made it, just for fun.

In the future I hope to complete the project with a compiler. The idea
is to generate this MK code from a high-level language. This work will
be harder. I expect to have enough energy to work on it.

If you want to help me and learn some things about compilers and
traductors, of course, you are invited ;-)



	WRITING PROGRAMS

MK is a simple language based on commands to a stack-based virtual
machine.  You can take the examples code as a start point to write
your first programs in MK. Our idea is to build a compiler that it
generates  this MK programs from a high-level language but, by now, if
you want to test the virtual machine, you must write your own codes on
MK.

All programs on MK must have a function named 'main' and if you want,
more functions with any names. It is recommended to look the web
reference in the wiki of the project.

To run an MK code you have to use mkm tool:

   $ mkm examples/stdio.vm
